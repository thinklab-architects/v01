# OpenAI Web Codex Environment

This project sets up a Python backend and a JavaScript/React frontend for interacting with the OpenAI Codex API.

## Getting Started

1. Install Python dependencies: `pip install flask openai`
2. Install frontend dependencies: `npm install` in the frontend directory (to be created).
3. Configure your OpenAI API key in a `.env` file.
4. Run the backend: `python app.py`
5. Run the frontend: `npm start` in the frontend directory.

## Structure
- `app.py`: Flask backend for Codex API calls
- `frontend/`: React frontend for user interaction

## Customization
Update the backend and frontend code to suit your workflow.
